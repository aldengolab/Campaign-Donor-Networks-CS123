## What's Here

There are a few files in this directory worth pointing out: 

+ `requirements.txt` is the requirements file for running; all code is in Pyhon 2.7
+ `aws1.json` is the JSON used for entity resolution in the large dataset

  + `explore_3.py` - pulls unique donor/recipient pairs from dataset
  + `sample_records.py` - randomly samples from the full dataset
2. `entity_reduction_scripts`
  + `F500_json_MR.py` - bulids a JSON of {nameInstance: authoritativeName} for all Fortune 500 companies
3. `data_crunching` 
  + `corporate_donations_MRJob.py` - aggregates F500 corporate donations into a csv
